# Cultivating Local Yokals Society Website

This is a [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/)-powered website, meaning what's on the server is static HTML. Everything is generated by Ruby before getting pushed into the webroot.

## Hacking

**Note:** Middleman requires an up-to-date and fully-functional Ruby environment on your computer. Please see the Ruby documentation for more information on setting up a development environment if you haven't done so already.

### Quickstart:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/alexblackie/localyokals.git; cd localyokals`
2. Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Run the server: `bundle exec middleman s`
4. Visit `http://localhost:4567/`
