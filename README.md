# Cultivating Local Yokals Society Website

This is a [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/)-powered website, meaning what's on the server is static HTML. Everything is generated by Ruby before getting pushed into the webroot.

## Hacking

**Note:** Middleman requires an up-to-date and fully-functional Ruby environment on your computer. Please see the Ruby documentation for more information on setting up a development environment if you haven't done so already.

### Quickstart:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/alexblackie/localyokals.git; cd localyokals`
2. Install the dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Run the server: `bundle exec middleman s`
4. Visit http://localhost:4567/

## Deploying

I have a [Git post-receive hook](https://gist.github.com/alexblackie/4681698) that will automagically deploy a Middleman site when it receives a push from your local Git repository. This makes deploying changes as easy as `git push`.

Otherwise, run `bundle exec middleman build` and upload the contents of the `./build` directory to the server.
