		%p
			In 2011, our society was asked if they would help the Boys and
			Girls Club in Metchosin with the design and development of an
			organic garden.

		%p
			The project started in April. We fenced-in an area of approximately
			three-quarters of an acre. We were working with St. Michael's High
			School volunteers on this project, and they were a great help. We
			appreciate their efforts.
